Installation Instructions
*************************

Compiling and installing the LV2 plugin
=======================================
Run ./configure --enable-lv2 --prefix=/usr
Then run 'make && make install' and the plugion should be installed in
/usr/lib/lv2/drumgizmo.lv2
If you want to compile only the LV2 parts of the plugin use
'--disable-editor --disable-cli' as additional parameters to the configure
script.

The LV2 plugin requires the following dependencies:
pkg-config >= 0.23
lv2 >= 1.0
Xlib >= 1.0
sndfile >= 1.0.21
libpng >= 1.2
pthread (no minimal version specified)
expat (no minimal version specified)

Be aware that if you are planning on running the LV2 plugin from within one
of the binary releases of Ardour, you must make sure that drumgizmo is using
the same version of libpng, pthread and expat as Ardour was compiled with (or
at least versions matching the ABI), otherwise the plugin will show strange
behaviour or even crash upon load.
